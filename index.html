          <h2>Residual Summer - 2016</h2>
          <p>
            In 2016, I picked up painting again after a long hiatus. I received
            some paint supplies as a gift and didn't know what to create at
            first, so I decided to paint swirls on a canvas. I had a couple
            people over one day, and a friend of a friend bought it off the
            easel. This sale sparked the start of my journey as a professional
            artist.

          <p>
            In early 2017, I created my own custom alcohol based inks and began
            airbrushing with them on polypropylene paper. I created this piece,
            and sold it to a friend who would later buy more artwork from me.

            Calamari was the second airbrush ink painting I created, but this
            time I decided to add a fine line drawing on top.

          <h2>Arches - 2017</h2>
          <p>
            I created Arches by mixing acrylic paint with water and pouring
            medium. It reminded me of the landscapes and deserts of the west.
            Arches was the first painting I sold to someone that I had never met
            with the help of social media.

          <p>
            The Drift painting was the first ink painting I sealed with resin.
            The glossy finish improved the quality and durability of the
            artwork. This was the first painting I sold to someone outside of
            the USA.

            Galactic Coast was another acrylic pour painting I made inspired by
            nature. I sold this painting to someone in Miami during a music
            festival. He said it reminded him of the ocean and space!

          <h2>Watershed - 2019</h2>
          <p>
            This painting was the largest and most challenging creation I had
            made up to that point. I built a custom wooden frame, sealed my own
            paper on top, taking extra care to prevent air bubbles. I airbrushed
            my custom inks onto the piece, then sealed it with two gallons of
            resin in a dust free room I built in a lab. I then used a heat gun
            to dissipate any air bubbles that would come to the surface. The
            room was temperature controlled at 72 degrees, with 54 percent
            humidity to allow the best environment for curing the resin. After
            waiting 72 hours, I entered the room again to sand down the edges
            and transport it to my client. This painting was commissioned by one
            of my friend's customers, who mentioned she needed large artwork for
            her new home.

            I created hourglass as an abstract experiment using both hands
            simultaneously to paint. It was the fastest painting I ever created
            and I sold it to someone I worked with in Los Angeles.

          <p>
            This painting was inspired by a style that I had been working on for
            quite some time. I loved painting with palette knives ever since
            watching Bob Ross on TV as a child. This painting was created layer
            by layer, loading thick oil paint onto the knives and spreading it
            on the canvas. I worked on this through much of the first year of
            the pandemic. This style of painting takes patience and is still my
            favorite way to paint today.

          <h2>Utopian Rebirth - 2021</h2>
          <p>
            I painted Utopian Rebirth for a client who commissioned it from Palm
            Springs, CA. While I lived on the west coast, I was inspired by the
            mountainous landscapes and deserts, but missed the lush green fields
            I grew up on in the midwest. This painting mixes both and represents
            new beginnings. I mixed the paint with binders and modeling paste to
            add more texture to the sun rays and the mountains.

          <p>
            This set of paintings was the first series I sold as a tryptic
            piece. The three paintings go together to form an abstract scene. I
            sold these paintings to someone I met at a christmas party in Saint
            Louis. I used acrylic paint and metallic inks to create them. People
            who have viewed it have mentioned seeing mountains, a dolphin, a
            nun, a basket, a beach ball, sand, and more. I like that this series
            inspires creativity in the viewer.

            The Joshua painting was inspired by a group trip I took with friends
            to Joshua tree in the summer of 2021 during a full moon. The desert
            was glowing from the bright moon and zero light polution. I used my
            favorite painting style, layered oil paint with knives to create
            this painting. I ended up gifting this painting to my friends who
            planned the trip for us.

          <p>
            Santa Monica is the first residential mural I created for clients
            who moved from Los Angeles to Austin Texas. They wanted to fill
            their stair case with a mural to remind them of their time in LA, so
            I painted the Santa Monica sunset with palm tree sillhouettes.
            Painting this mural was challenging due to the steps and the odd
            angle of the ladder, but it was fun to create something so large and
            beautiful.

          <p>
            After painting the Santa Monica mural, my clients asked me to come
            back the following year to do a mural in their bathroom. I painted
            all four walls and the ceiling. I decided to keep it colorful and
            integrate tropical plants, wavy lines, contrasting colors, and color
            blocked shapes and buildings. I unintentionally painted this mural
            during an ice storm and power outtage in Austin, TX. I had to wear a
            head lamp and many layers to get through it, which I think added to
            the character of the mural.
